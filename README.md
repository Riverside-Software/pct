PCT (Progress Compilation Tools) is a set of [Ant](http://ant.apache.org) tasks for the [OpenEdge](https://www.progress.com/openedge) environment.

PCT is distributed under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

This project was born due to the lack of automated OpenEdge build environment. PCT is a command-line based tool, so it can be run in batch mode, to generate nightly builds or for continuous integration.

PCT has been designed and written by Gilles QUERRET ([Riverside Software](http://riverside-software.fr)).

### What's next

* Need to assess the quality of your source code ? Find bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells ? Then try the [OpenEdge plugin](https://github.com/Riverside-Software/sonar-openedge) for [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org).
* Working with [OpenEdge WebClient](https://www.progress.com/support/openedge/webclient-executables)? Then you may want to use [Padeo](http://riverside-software.fr/trial.html) to build and distribute applications in a completely automated way.

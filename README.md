PCT (Progress Compilation Tools) is a set of ANT tasks, designed to automate work in OpenEdge environment.

PCT is distributed under the Apache License.

This project was born due to the lack of automated OpenEdge code compiler. PCT is a command-line based tool, so it can be run in batch mode, to generate nightly builds or for continuous integration. However, as PCT is a set of ANT tasks, your compilation tasks can be run using a graphical frontend to ANT.

PCT was designed and written by Gilles QUERRET (g.querret at gmail.com), freelance developer for Riverside Software in France.

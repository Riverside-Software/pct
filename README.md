PCT is a set of [Ant](http://ant.apache.org) tasks for the [OpenEdge](https://www.progress.com/openedge) environment, distributed under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

This project was born due to the lack of automated OpenEdge build environment. PCT is a command-line based tool, so you can use it in with any continuous integration and delivery product.

PCT has been designed and written by Gilles QUERRET ([Riverside Software](http://riverside-software.fr)).

### What's next

* Need to assess the quality of your source code ? Find bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells ? Then try [CABL](https://riverside-software.fr/progress-openedge-abl-features-for-cleaner-and-safer-code) for [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org).
* Working with [OpenEdge WebClient](https://www.progress.com/support/openedge/webclient-executables)? Then you may want to use [PDO](https://pdo.riverside-software.fr) to build and distribute applications in a completely automated way.

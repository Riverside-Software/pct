   Business Entity Names without a . (dot) will be considered

   Note, the use of the procedural business entities is still 
   supported. However we've received requests from customers just 
   using the OO versions of the business entities that this is 
   considered unnecessary legacy code... As the OO OERA backend 
   has more functionality (e.g. FindOnServer, backwards batching) 
   we do not intend to implement an "ExcludeObjectOrientedOERA" 
   switch for customers that are not (yet) using OO business
